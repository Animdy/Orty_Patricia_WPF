// Conditional Logic - Relational Expressions

var kidHeight = 49;
var minHeight = 48;

//if the kid is over 48 inches in height : good to state out if than statemend in plain english prior to coding it.
//can compair with a static number...ie. kidHeight > 48 or can compair to another variable as shown.

if(kidHeight > minHeight){ 
	//code performed if condition is true
	console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}
