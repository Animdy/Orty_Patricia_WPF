// Assignment : Expressions - Wacky

//This expression is suppost to be Wacky, soooo I went with an absurd theme of sock Gnomes. 
//Probably had to do with that I just did laundry but anyway... 
//this expression's goal is going to be to calculate the number of socks a person would have to pay to the sock Gnomes,
//in order to have no socks missing after the drying of their clothes for one year. Enjoy!

//Declaring the variables for later use in this expression.
var howManyStipedSocks;
var howManyToes;
var howManyWool;
var howManyWashesMo;

//Placing in a series of  3 alerts to explain the prompts for information to follow.

alert("Do you end up SEARCHING after you do laundry for your FAVORITE SOCK?\nDO YOU WISH you had a CHOICE over what the laundry Gnomes would take?");
