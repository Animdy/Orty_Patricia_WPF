// Assignment : Expressions - Wacky

//This expression is suppost to be Wacky, soooo I went with an absurd theme of sock Gnomes. 
//Probably had to do with that I just did laundry but anyway... 
//this expression's goal is going to be to calculate the number of socks a person would have to pay to the sock Gnomes,
//in order to have no socks missing after the drying of their clothes for one year. Enjoy!

//Declaring the variables for later use in this expression.
var howManyStipedSocks;
var howManyToes;
var howManyWool;
var howManyWashesMo;

//Placing in a series of  3 alerts to explain the prompts for information to follow.

alert("Do you end up SEARCHING after you do laundry for your FAVORITE SOCK?\nDO YOU WISH you had a CHOICE over what the laundry Gnomes would take?");
alert("Well you're in LUCK MY FRIEND!\nTODAY IS YOUR LUCKY DAY!!");
alert("Answer the next few questions and we shall calculate \nyour NECESSARY YEARLY SOCK PAYMENT!!!\nIMAGINE being able to launder your clothing with the \npeace of mind that you WILL NOT LOSE 1 sock for 1 year! \nIMAGINE the possibilities.\n\n\t\tBest Jammy Regards,\n\t\tToesy Rosey-Jam the Gnome");

//Prompts being created to gather information for the expression calculations later.

howManyStripedStocks = prompt("Let's start our calculation for a fuzzy tariff, \nto our stubby sock fashionista Gnomes, with...\n\t...HOW MANY striped socks to you own?");

howManyToes = prompt("5, 10 or 2! How many toes do you cover with socks a day?");

howManyWool = prompt("Do you act like a wolf and don WOOLEY SOCKS...\nIf YES, HOW MANY Wool sock pairs do you have?");
