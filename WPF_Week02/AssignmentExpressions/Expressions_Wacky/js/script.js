// Assignment : Expressions - Wacky

//This expression is suppost to be Wacky, soooo I went with an absurd theme of sock Gnomes. 
//Probably had to do with that I just did laundry but anyway... 
//this expression's goal is going to be to calculate the number of socks a person would have to pay to the sock Gnomes,
//in order to have no socks missing after the drying of their clothes for one year. Enjoy!

//Declaring the variables for later use in this expression.
