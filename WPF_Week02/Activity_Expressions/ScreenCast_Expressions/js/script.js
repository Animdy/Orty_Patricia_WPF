// Expressions

var a = 2; //sets up our variable a and defines it with 2
a + 3; // add 3 to a 

// output would still show variable 2 as a because the a + 3; didn't change var a .
//doesn't show a + 3 because it doesn't have an assignment operator... nothing is storing the a + 3

console.log(a);

//you can add in the console output shown below:

console.log(a + 3);

//or you can store it by changing the a variable or making the output a new variable as below

var b = a + 3;

console.log("variable a = " + a + " & " + "variable b = " + b);

//shows that a was not changed and addition was saved in the assignment operator : variable b
