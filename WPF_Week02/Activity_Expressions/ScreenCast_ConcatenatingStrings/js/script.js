// Expressions - Concatenating Strings

var firstName = "Patti";

var lastName = "Orty";

var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

console.log(fullName);

// be carefull not to confuse adding numbers and concatinating strings

var a = "6";
var b = "7";

var result = a + b;

console.log(result);

// this is going to show result as 67 because the numbers are between " " they are recognized as text not numbers
// so the a + b is a concatination of those two characters 6 & 7
// to have them as numbers and to have a + b be addition then the numbers can't be in "

var c = 6;
var d = 7;

var addition = c + d;

console.log(addition);
